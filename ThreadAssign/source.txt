Timer class uses Object wait and notify methods to schedule the tasks. TimerTask
 is an abstract class and we inherit it to provide concrete implementation. TimerTask 
 class implements Runnable interface so it is a thread and hence your implementation of 
 TimerTask is also a thread.

Very simple Timer and TimerTask Example: Task executes once 5 seconds have passed.
